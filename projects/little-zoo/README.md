# Pikku Eläintarha (Little Zoo) 🦊🐻🦅  

This is a small project where we practice **arrays, objects, loops, conditions, functions, and DOM manipulation** by building a mini animal tracking app.  

It’s written in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and shows how to create an interactive webpage where you can manage a list of animals.
